The deep-learning module incorporate essential procedures to prepare remote sensing images mostly for automatic classification methods, in this case specifically, deep-learning approaches.

Beyond the routines, this code was prepared to have a personal use or even ready for adaptation to be run in server-side. The ain is to incorporate some of the main Deep Learning models for remote sensing image analysis and mapping. In this version, the following DL architectures were tested:
